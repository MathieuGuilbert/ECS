# ECS
This repository contains the code associated to the Explainable Clustering (ensemble) Selection (ECS) approach. 

File "imports" is a script importing all necesary libraries.

%----------------

Code is separated as follows:


partitionCreation.py : contains the CP model, and the function launchICES launching the entire pipeline. 
Note: for now, to vary the parameters of the generation, selection and model steps modifying them in launchICES function is needed.

clusterSelection.py: handling the base partition generation, cluster selection and description generation steps

postProcess.py: contains all functions needed after the execution of the model, such as quality measures

compare.py: contains functions used to compare our approach to others.

dataTreatment.py: functions needed to read our different datasets.

clusterQuality.py: Evaluation of individual cluster qualities.


%----------------

Objective criterions of the CP models are as follows:
0 : minimize number of instances attributed to 0 cluster
1 : minimize number of clusters selected
5 : minimize overall number of patterns selected 
2 : maximize number of instances attributed to one and only one cluster
3 : maximize overall number of descriptors selected in cluster descriptions
4 : maximize number of clusters selected
7 : maximize number of instances covered by at least one pattern.
8 : minimize number of instances covered by at least one pattern.
9 : maximize number of instances covered by at least one pattern AND belonging to precisly one cluster.

This work was developped by Mathieu Guilbert, and is associated to the ECS approach written by Mathieu Guilbert, Christel Vrain and Thi-Bich-Hanh Dao from the LIFO laboratory in Orl√©ans, France.
